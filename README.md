Hello! I'm Steph. 

I have a degree in Biology, with a minor in Chemistry. I love to learn new things, and have spent the last few years
exploring different places and fields. I'm currently trying my hand at software development.

I am studying with Promineo Tech, in their Front-End Bootcamp. I will be learning more about Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
I look forward to being albe to apply what I am learning now to real-world applications.
