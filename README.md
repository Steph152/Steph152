Hello! I'm Steph. 

I have a degree in Biology, with a minor in Chemistry. I love to learn new things, and have spent the last few years
exploring different places and fields. I am currently a front-end engineer.
I studied with Promineo Tech, in their Front-End Bootcamp. I learned about Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
